BUG FABLES SAVE FORMAT DOCUMENTATION (1.1.x PC format)

By aldelaro5 with the help of ZHugeEx, Benjee, wataniyob and Wintar

A save file in Bug Fables is a XOR encrypted regular text file. It is a very simple 
symetric encryption scheme where each bytes is XORed with a number called the key. 
This key is present in the TextAsset located at "Ressources/Data/Key" in the asset tree.

The operation to encrypt or decrypt are identical.

The file is composed of exactly 18 lines. There are 3 types of line format:
- Fields line: contain fields of various meaning, separated by ",".
- List line: contain a list of items, separated by "," unless specified otherwise.
- Array line: contain an array, each element is separated by "@" and each element is either a list or fields.

Along this document, 3 other documents are provided for details about the ID of elements 
refferenced within the save file. One contains appendixes for any element except flags 
the second is for the three kinds of global flags (flags, flagstring and flagvar) and the
third is for all the regionalflags per areas.

A note on format versions; there were 2 changes done to the format in the 1.1.0 version of the game. Specifically, the amount of items in the flagvar and flags line have increased. When a 1.0.x save file is loaded into the game, it will load normally, but with the new items getting a default value (in this case, "false"). The game uses a specific flag (see appendix on glabal flags) to determine if the file is in 1.0.x format or 1.1.x format. If it detects it's a 1.0.5 file, it will perform some directives to adapt it as some logic changes and flags changes impacted it. Once it is done, it will set the flag checked earlier to true which will prevent the game from performing the conversion twice. This works because the flag used is not used in 1.0.x so it will never be "true" until the conversioon is done in 1.1.x. This will only persist once a save in the game is performed at which point, the save file is permanently converted to a 1.1.x format.

The following is the details of the format:

Line 1 (Fields line) Header

This line serves as a header.
