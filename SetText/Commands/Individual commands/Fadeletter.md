# Fadeletter

Toggle the fade letter font effect from inactive to active or from active to inactive.

## Syntax

````
|fadeletter|
````

## Parameters

None.

## Remarks

Fade letter is a font effect that will have every letter initially render fully transparent, but slowly fade into their target color.

This font effect only works in [Single Letter Rendering](../../Letter%20Rendering%20Methods/Single%20Letter%20Rendering.md) and doing this command in that rendering method will effectively do nothing.
